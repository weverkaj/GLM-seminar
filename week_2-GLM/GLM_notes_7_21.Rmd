Motivation for extending lm
  - when assumptions break down
  - distribution used in GLM are used from natural exponential family of distributions
  
  
All exponential family distributions can be put in an exponent form
  - theta and phi
    - theta is "canonical"
    - phi is "dispersion"
  - look at which has an i subscript
  
3 components to a GLM
  - Random component (probability distribution)
    - in regular lm it's normal distribution, but can be anything for GLM
  - Systematic component
  - Link function
    - operates on mean (not on response variable)
